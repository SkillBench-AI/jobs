# What We're Building: The SkillBench Platform
- **AI-powered tools** that analyze vast enterprise documents and data to construct comprehensive "task maps", a graph-based representation of the firm's tasks
- **Predictive models** that forecast and diagnose the impact of automation on productivity and skill development
- **User interfaces** that empower managers and employees with different roles and hierarchies to make data-driven decisions about AI adoption
- **Work design tools** that help firms optimize their automation strategies and AI policies


# Why Join Us
- **Make a real impact**: Our work shapes both the future of work and AI-enhanced productivity and growth. Our 	collaborators include top AI and work management companies in Silicon Valley, and our early traction includes leading global companies waiting to implement our solutions.
- **Join an awesome team**: Founded by [Matt Beane](https://www.mattbeane.com/) and [Juho Kim](https://juhokim.com/), with pre-seed funding from top investors in the U.S. and South Korea. Join a tight-knit, global team of experts in AI, Human-Computer Interaction, and management.
- **Drive Research-Backed Innovation**: We bridge the gap between academic research and real-world impact. Our academic roots fuel our curiosity, while our product focus keeps us grounded in practical solutions. You'll have the unique opportunity to apply cutting-edge research directly to product development. We're not just building a product; we're advancing the science behind it.
- **Grow rapidly**: Our vision to achieve productivity and skill growth simultaneously starts within our team. Experience unparalleled personal and professional growth in a fast-paced, evolving domain.


# Our Core Values
- **Learning and Growth**: We champion continuous learning and personal growth, mirroring our product's mission to enhance human skills in the AI era. We actively seek opportunities to expand our knowledge, challenge our assumptions, and learn from each other.
- **Global Synergy**: We thrive on diverse perspectives and foster clear, empathetic communication across time zones and cultures. Our globally distributed team is our strength, driving innovation through collaboration.
- **Proactive Ownership**: We encourage everyone to take initiative, own their work, and drive projects forward. Self-motivation and a can-do attitude are at the heart of our culture.
- **Human-Centric AI Innovation**: In all our AI endeavors, we prioritize the human element. We strive to create technology that enhances human capabilities, respects individual dignity, and promotes positive societal impact.


# We're Looking For
### Exceptional engineers who are:
- Passionate about pushing the boundaries of AI and its application in enterprise settings
- Excited to take on and solve complex technical challenges, from building a scalable task analysis engine to making AI-powered interfaces to designing human-AI collaboration workflows
- Motivated to shape the future of work and leave a lasting impact on how organizations operate

### Work environment:
- **Fully Remote**: Our positions are fully remote. We're primarily seeking candidates based in **the U.S. or South Korea**, but we're open to discussing options for working from other countries.  We've built our processes and culture around effective remote collaboration.
- **Flexible Office Support**: While we're primarily remote, we understand that some team members may prefer or occasionally need a shared workspace. We support access to co-working spaces or shared offices in your location.
- **Team Offsites**: We believe in the power of face-to-face interactions to build stronger bonds and spark innovation. We organize team offsites 1-2 times a year, bringing the whole team together for collaboration, strategic planning, and team building.
- **Competitive Compensation**: We offer competitive salaries, equity options, and a comprehensive benefits package.
